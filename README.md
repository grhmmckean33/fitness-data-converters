# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Here I have produced a handcycle and rowing machine data converters and results databases:

1. hcycle_v2.py - Located in: >>> Handcycle Data Converter V2 >>> Handcycle Converter V2 - OOP >>> hcycle_v2.py

# BACKGROUND:
The scenario is as a disabled fitness enthusiast, my indoor rowing machine and hand bike did not give the distance covered in km or miles they only told you how many rowing strokes or pedal revolutions you had done during your session. This was a way of approximately gauging the distance I had covered. As a bonus I also had my heart rate statistics from my smartwatch, but no way of recording the data separately as to which heart rate level I had reached. With this in mind I set to work creating the Rowing Machine Converter and the Handcycle Converter.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Python Packages - 
1. tkinter
2. customtkinter
3. ttkbootstrap
4. tkinter - messagebox
5. sqlite3
6. PIL - ImageTk
   
# REQUIREMENTS:
1. Python 3.11
2. DB Browser for SQLite

# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
Rowing Machine Converter - latest version V2:
1. Download Rowing Machine Data Converter folder and contents.
2. From within your chosen Python code compiler (ie. VisualStudio or PyCharm), open and run the stroke_v2.py file contained in the Rowing Machine Converter V2 folder.
3. The program should run and you can fill in the data by completing the fields and using the data sliders.
4. When you then hit the 'Submit' button it will then automatically show the conversions on screen as saving the data to the rowing_data6.db.
5. Open 'DB Browser for SQLite' that you will have installed on your PC and navigate to the rowing_data6.db file and open it to view the data you have just created.

Handcycle Data Converter - latest version V2:
1. Download Handcycle Data Converter folder and contents.
2. From within your chosen Python code compiler (ie. VisualStudio or PyCharm), open and run the hcycle_v2.py file contained in the Handcycle Converter V2 folder.
3. The program should run and you can fill in the data by completing the fields and using the data sliders.
4. When you then hit the 'Submit' button it will then automatically show the conversions on screen as saving the data to the hcycle_data4.db.
5. Open 'DB Browser for SQLite' that you will have installed on your PC and navigate to the hcycle_data4.db file and open it to view the data you have just created.
